# inventorgg/compare
This repository hosts a comprehensive comparison of the features of Discord bot hosting services across different plans. We ([inventor.gg](https://inventor.gg)) use this list to generate [comparison pages](https://inventor.gg/compare) on our marketing site.

## Why?
When companies compare themselves to competitors, those comparisons are often one-sided with cherry-picked data. We wanted our website to offer more honest comparison pages, so we decided to open-source the configuration file used to generate our comparison pages. We welcome contributions and suggestions from the community to improve this list and have licensed the list permissively so it can be used by others.

## Bot Makers
This list currently compares the following bot makers:

- inventor.gg
- botwiz.dev
- botghost.com

We are currently only planning on including bot makers that are cloud-based and include hosting. We may expand to other types of bot makers in the future.

## Contributing
If you notice anything inaccurate or out of date on the list, or believe we should be tracking a new metric, please submit a pull request.

We may also accept PRs for new bot maker products. Please remember to update the list on the README.

For large changes, consider opening an issue (before collecting and inputting the data) to ask if we would be interested in your proposed changes. We may not approve PRs that add bot makers we consider out of scope or that significantly increase the maintenance required to keep this list accurate and up to date.

Updates to this repo will not be immediately reflected on the Inventor website comparison pages.

## Usage
This comparison file is open source under the MIT License. Other websites and bot makers are welcome to use this list or build upon it for any purpose.

The code and templates used to generate Inventor's comparison pages is not open source.
